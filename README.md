# A Sample Project Using CSLA.NET With Dependency Injection
A project to demonstrate how dependency injection using [Unity](http://unity.codeplex.com/) can be done in the popular [CSLA.NET](http://www.cslanet.com/).
I also created a [blog post](http://aiampogi.blogspot.com/2013/08/cslanet-with-dependency-injection.html) to somehow explain the things done in order to accomplish this.
