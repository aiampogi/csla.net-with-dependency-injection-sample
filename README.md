[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/4tefi883e77prua5?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/aiampogi/csla-net-with-dependency-injection-sample)

A project to demonstrate how dependency injection using [Unity](http://unity.codeplex.com/) can be done in the popular [CSLA.NET](http://www.cslanet.com/).
I also created a [blog post](http://aiampogi.blogspot.com/2013/08/cslanet-with-dependency-injection.html) to somehow explain the things done in order to accomplish this.
